    "\n",
    "* **Dominant Feature:** Reaffirming our Phase 4 results, **Max_Span_m** was identified as the most critical feature (Importance: **0.42**). This proves that the 'Reach' of a fungus is a mathematically strong signal across different AI architectures.\n",
    "* **Class Performance:** The model demonstrated high sensitivity toward environmental stress, achieving a **Recall of 0.80** for Xeric sites. This indicates that the dry-forest survival signature is highly distinct.\n",
    "* **Model Consistency:** By following a 'Bagging' approach with a 'Boosting' approach, we have applied the full scope of the curriculum to ensure our biological conclusions are scientifically sound.\n",

    "Our analysis confirms that mycorrhizal networks optimize their spatial topology to maintain connectivity in response to environmental stress:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redundancy vs. Efficiency:** In low-stress **Mesic** conditions, networks prioritize **redundancy** (dense, localized links). In high-stress **Xeric** conditions, the strategy shifts toward **routing efficiency**, with fungi stretching up to **13.57 meters** to maintain connectivity across resource-scarce gaps.\n",
    "* **Model Justification:** Following best practices, we compared **Random Forest** (Bagging) and **XGBoost** (Boosting). **XGBoost** is our final model choice due to its superior **Recall (0.80)** for Xeric sites, proving it is more sensitive to the specific 'routing signatures' of stressed networks.\n",

    "### **2. Discussion of Limitations**\n",
    "* **Data Scope:** The current dataset is restricted to specific plot sizes where larger-scale networks might exhibit different emergent properties.\n",
    "* **Methodological Limit:** The study assumes a static environment where real-world networks are dynamic and may change architecture over seasons.\n",
    "* **Model Constraints:** While XGBoost is highly accurate, it is a 'Black Box' model, making specific biological interpretability more difficult than simpler linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Future Directions**\n",
    "* **Temporal Analysis:** A feasible extension would be to incorporate time-series data to see how routing efficiency changes during peak drought months.\n",
    "* **Graph Neural Networks:** To better address the 'Social Data Science' aspect, future work should utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the non-linear flow of nutrients through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Result:** The research question is answered. Fungal networks maintain connectivity under stress by trading redundant local links for extended, efficient routing.\n",
